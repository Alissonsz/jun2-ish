 This app was built inpired by other [project](https://github.com/alissonsz/videoParty) made by me for the same purpose. The main goal was use the new skills and knowledges that i got to make it better than the last one, and use the oportunity to practice some technologies, like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and Websockets, in besides building a useful website.
 The website is capable of creating rooms with a text chat and a video, keeping the video synchronized to everyone on the room, using websockets, the server repository can be found at [server](https://github.com/alissonsz/jun2-ish_backend).
